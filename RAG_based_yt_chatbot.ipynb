But today with less than\\n8,000 remaining, it's our job to protect these extraordinary\\ncreatures from extinction, so that they can keep inspiring us\\nall to push beyond our limits. Millie is like the sweetest animal\\nI've ever met.\\n\\na different idea. Hey, what's up? So I'm sitting up\\nin a tree about 50 ft up. And the only tree in-play. Here's the whole yard where\\neverybody's hiding. I just pray that God will hide\\nmy scent. Hopefully they\\ndon’t find me. The 10 minute timer is up!\\nWe're coming to find you. Here they go.\\nYou can hear the dog. 3, 2, 1… Release the hounds! - And they were off. Let's go.\\n- Alright, we're good? Yep. Watch the dog\\nand his behavior. You'll see it when he\\ncatches that odor. You’ll see his nose\\ngoes up. How can dogs smell\\nthis good? It's called their olfactors. The longer the snout, the more\\nolfactors that these dogs have. It’s nice and windy up here so\\nthey shouldn’t be able to smell me. I know it’s a win for me because\\nI’m not near the ground. Remember, this is\\na very large area. So the dog has to systematically\\ndecipher what odor is a person. And what's just somebody who\\nwalked through here earlier. Alert! Alright. Standby. Sage might’ve found\\nsomething. Oh, the doors are\\n\\nthat weigh 1,500 lbs each. ‘Bout to touch him\\nright on the head. He's adopting a strategy of\\nscaring the bulls away? This is hard! Note to self: don't do these things\\nwith professionals. He literally breezed through\\nthis challenge. - Woah, he did it!\\n- There you go. You won! - Congrats on winning $50,000!\\n- Thank you. What're you gonna spend\\nthe money on? Probably\\na new truck. Why am I not\\nsurprised? But what will surprise you is who\\nwins the race later in this video. But this next challenge has\\n2 creatures built to shatter every bone\\nin your body. Alright, Nick. Come through\\nthese doors. I'm terrified. This is Nick, who you might remember from his race\\nagainst the fastest man on the planet where, even with a mile headstart,\\nhe still lost to Noah Lyles. And today, I'm gonna be giving him\\na second chance at something\\na little more deadly. In front of you. Just— I can't, bro.\\nI can't touch, bro. - Trust me.\\n- No, no. In front of you… - Bro…\\n- Bro, bro— When you see this footage, you're\\n\\nnext to this right now. Come here, Millie. I can't believe I'm literally calling\\na cheetah over to me. It is so big. Give it a pet, Nolan. Nolan, stop touching it.\\nIt did not like when you touched it. You guys are actually crazy. Oh my gosh, this cheetah's literally\\nexactly like a giant cat. You’re so cute! We're giving the cheetah a little bit\\nof a break in between the race, that way it's not too\\nout of breath. And in case you guys\\nare curious, we partnered with\\nthe American Humane Society, which is basically making sure\\nthat all the animals are being ethically treated\\nwhile we're filming this video. That's because today there are less\\nthan 8,000 cheetahs living on earth, which is why it's important to me\\nthat all of these endangered animals are treated very carefully\\non our set. It's so soft! The cheetah is purring\\ninsanely loud. That means it\\nlikes us. It looks like Millie is ready for\\nthe next race. Let's get this on\\nthe road. It's finally time for the moment \\n    question : is it related to wild animals?\\n    \")"
